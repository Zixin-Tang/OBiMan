## Few-shot Demonstrations
Below are some Successful Examples and Failed Examples. Please carefully study them, especially the failures.

### Failed Examples
### Failed Example 1
[Task instruction] "## Scenario description: There is a (white bottle) and a (box) on the table. The (white bottles) are on the right side of the table and the (box) is located on the left side. ## Defined workspace: Notice that the [left hand] cannot approach (white bottle), while [right hand] can approach all objects on the table. ## Objective: Please put the bottle in the box. ## Completion instruction: After the task is completed, please move the robot arms to the initial poses."


The final output should be:
Stages:
- Stage 1: <right hand> [approach] (white bottle+center)
- Stage 2: <right hand> [grasp] (white bottle)
- Stage 3: <both hand> [align] (white bottle)
- Stage 4: <left hand> [grasp] (white bottle)
- Stage 5: <right hand> [place] (white bottle)
- Stage 6: <left hand> [approach] (box+center)
- Stage 7: <left hand> [place] (white bottle) to (box)
- Stage 8: <right hand> [approach] to (the right initial pose)
- Stage 9: <left hand> [approach] to (the left initial pose)

Task plan:
- Subtask 1: <right hand> [approach] (white bottle+center) #One
- Subtask 2: <right hand> [grasp] (white bottle) #One
- Subtask 3: <both hand> [align] (white bottle) #Two
- Subtask 4: <left hand> [grasp] (white bottle) #One
- Subtask 5: <right hand> [place] (white bottle) #One
- Subtask 6: <left hand> [approach] (box+center) #One
- Subtask 7: <left hand> [place] (white bottle) to (box) #One
- Subtask 8: <right hand> [approach] to (the right initial pose) and <left hand> [approach] to (the left initial pose) #One


Reflection:
Failed reason is: Although [left hand] cannot approach (white bottle), it does not matter because <right hand> can approach all objects on the table, it can directly [approach] (box+center) and [place] (box) without the unnecessary subtasks for handover with [align]



### Failed Example 2
[Task instruction] "## Scenario description: There is a (glass) and a (pan) on the table. The (glass) is on the right side of the table and the (pan) is on the right side. ## Objective: Please pour all particles in the glass into the pan. ## Defined workspace: Notice that [left hand] and [right hand] can approach all objects on the table. ## Completion instruction: After the task is completed, please move the robot arms to the initial poses."


#### Stages:
- Stage 1: <right hand> [approach] (glass+center)
- Stage 2: <right hand> [grasp] (glass)
- Stage 3: <left hand> [approach] (pan+handle)
- Stage 4: <left hand> [hold] (pan)
- Stage 5: <right hand> [pour] (glass) to (pan)
- Stage 6: <right hand> [place] (glass)
- Stage 7: <right hand> [approach] to (the right initial pose)
- Stage 8: <left hand> [approach] to (the left initial pose)

---

#### Task Plan:
- Subtask 1: <right hand> [approach] (glass+center) and <left hand> [approach] (pan+handle) #One
- Subtask 2: <right hand> [grasp] (glass) #One
- Subtask 3: <left hand> [hold] (pan) #One
- Subtask 4: <right hand> [pour] (glass) to (pan) #One
- Subtask 5: <right hand> [place] (glass) #One
- Subtask 6: <right hands> [approach] to (the right initial pose) and <left hands> [approach] to (the left initial pose) #One


Reflection:
Failed reason is: because [pour] skill will not move the object, [hold] is unnecessary.
